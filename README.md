# PROJECT - Ezhil
14 Days of Learning Challenge - JINA AI in Featurethon season 3 by Featurepreneur.

## What is our Project?
The learning journey was amazing and we got introduced to new the topic of neural search and how Jina AI facilitates it. In response to that, we created PROJECT - EZHIL . Our project can be used to find the RGB values and Hex code of the color in an image.\

## Why was PROJECT - EZHIL created?
We started our programming skills with the web development and designing. One prominent we faced and witnessed many others face were
 - Say, we like a color, but we don't know it's RGB or Hexcode, we can't possibly find the shade in the zillion colors out there.
 - Worst case, say we had the Hexcode but we lost it. That was a nightmare!

So we created the PROJECT - EZHIL to solve this problem. 

## Why the name PROJECT - EZHIL?
'Ezhil' ( pronounced as 'elil') is originated from the language of Tamil meaning 'beautiful'. So we named it to symbolise the beautiful colors that we come across.

## How we made it?
We created our own Executors with the help of the [Jina Document](https://docs.jina.ai/). We used the concept of Eucledian metric and matches to scan through the dataset we used to check if the color already exists. Scikit-image was used to obtain the color of the image.

## Libraries Utilised
- jina
- scikit-image
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- streamlit

We created our code in JupyterLab using these libraries.

## Future Plans with the project
- We would like to give the objects of the same color the user has entered.
- We plan to create an extension incoporating the same.

## Concluding Note:
The journey was exciting and we got the opportunity to explore a new concept which surely would take the industry by storm. We thank [Featurepreneur](https://featurepreneur.com/) for the opportunity. We would be sure to learn and exploit these resources and experiences more.
